            <img class="alt" src="images/teddy.jpg" alt="Teddy">
            <p>Theodore Roosevelt is the ultimate manly boxing cowboy president. Seemingly immune to bullets,
            it would probably take a perfectly executed triangle choke to wrangle this cowboy. Roosevelt
            is a bit  of a wild card, with less grappling experience than Washington and Taft, but way more
            boxing experience. He would probably have to bet on a first round knockout.

        <h3 id="Early">Early Life</h3>
        <p>Theodore Roosevelt was born as the runt of the litter to Teddy Roosevelt Sr. and Martha Stewart
        Billoch on October 27, 1858. He rejected his poor health and asthma, and implemented a heavy
        training regiment and took up boxing from an early age. Little did little Teddy know that the 
        manly chest muscles he began developing would aid in stopping a bullet to the chest during an
        assassination attempt later in his life.</p>

        <h3 id="Cowboy">Cowboy Escapades</h3>
        <p>After the death of his first wife, Roosevelt established Elkhorn Ranch in Dakota. Here he began
        his training with the cowboys, well known badasses at the time. He learned to rope, ride western
        style, and hunt, making him the ultimate handyman. In his book "The Lost Frontier", he wrote
        <blockquote cite="The Lost Frontier">
        "A cowboy will not submit tamely to an insult, and is ever ready to avenge his own wrongs; nor
        has he an overwrought fear of shedding blood. He possesses, in fact, few of the emasculated,
        milk-and-water moralities admired by the pseudo-philanthropists; but he does possess, to a very
        high degree, the stern, manly qualities that are invaluable to a nation."
        </blockquote></p>

        <h3 id="Riders">Rough Riders</h3>
        <p>Reentering the public eye in 1986 with the power of both a cowboy and a boxer, Roosevelt served as 
        a New York police comissioner until accepting the position of Assistant Secretary of the US Navy
        in 1897. When war broke out with Spain in 1898 he resigned from the post and formed the first 
        US voluntary cavalry regiment, referred to by the press as the  "Rough Riders". The Rough Riders
        became most famous for charging head first up Kettle Hill, securing a fortified position from 
        the spaniards and earning Roosevelt the Medal of Honor. Upon returning to civilian life, Roosevelt
        preferred to be referred to as "The Colonel", although "Teddy" remained more popular with the public,
        costing him some street credentials.</p>

        <h3 id="Presidency">Presidency</h3>
        <p>In 1899 Roosevelt was named Vice President, and eventually President in 1901 after the current President
        McKinley was shot. This did, however, not stop Roosevelt from continuing with his boxing, until a sparring 
        match left him blind in one eye in 1902. He then took up judo. He was also known to skinny dip during the 
        winter.</p>
        <p>In 1912, Roosevelt was shot in the chest prior to a speech while campaigning in Milwaukee. The bullet passed
        through the 50 page long speech and lodged 3 inches deep in his chest. Roosevelt refused medical attention,
        as he was not coughing blood and the bullet had therefore not penetrated his lungs, he proceeded to give 
        the speech. Roosevelt was about 180 cm, weight unknown.</p>
