        <p>Taft was the victim of some ridicule due to his weight and reluctance to talk to the press.
            Given his wrestling experience and possibly bottled up rage, we can easily see him rampaging
            through president after president. Even some of the stronger presidents would likely be chanceless
            if they ended up on the floor, Roosevelt and Washington would definitely have to stay on their
            toes when facing the wrath of Taft.

        <h3 id="Early">Early Life</h3>
        <p>William Howard Taft was born to Alphonso Taft and Louise Torrey september 15, 1857. He was
            considered a hard worker as a child which got him through his studies, but more importantly,
            made him an excellent wrestler. In the Taft family William was a 4th generation wrestler. 
            During his studies at Yale university he made intramural heavyweight champion.

        <h3 id="Law">Career in Law</h3>
        <p>In 1887 Taft was appointed to a vacancy on the Superior Court. He ruled with the confidence of a
            man who could wrestle and was subsequently elected to a full five-year term. During this time,
            his rulings and thick frame even attracted the attention of Helen Herron, with whom he remained 
            devoted through 44 years of marriage. He would go on to serve as Federal Judge and Secretary of
            War until ultimately being nominated for the presidency in 1908.

        <p>In 1909 William Taft became the thickest president of the United States of America. Being the
            strong silent type did not win him many favors with the media or in the public eye. Along with
            his impressive weight this made him prone to hefty ridicule and criticism. Taft lost the re
            election in 1912, making him the last American president with impressive facial hair. He stood
            about 6ft tall, weighing in at roughly 150kg.
