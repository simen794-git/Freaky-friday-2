    <p>The original President George Washington is often referred to as the Father the Nation, giving him
       immense dad-strength. Being a tall guy Washington would have a reach advantage over most presidents,
       but given his defeat of seven consecutive challengers from the Massachusetts volunteers
       during his time as the Commander of the Continental Armies at age 47 he would likely have some options
       if he ended up on the floor as well.

    <h3 id="Early">Early Life</h3>
    <p>George Washington was born to Augustine and Mary Washington on February 22, 1732. Details of his early 
       years are mostly prone to legend, such as him confessing to chopping down one of his father's cherry
       trees at age six because he could never tell a lie.

    <h3 id="Military">Military Career</h3>
    <p>Washington joined the ranks of the British army in 1753, proving himself a competent commander while
       fighting the French and Native Americans. As tensions were increasing leading up to The American
       Revolutionary War, Washington was outspoken towards the British oppression. As the war broke out in
       1775, Washington was named commander-in-chief. The war would last until peace negotiations began in
       1783, securing independence from the British.

    <h3 id="Presidency">Presidency</h3>
    <p>Washington was elected in 1789, and became the first President of the United States. He likely
        remains one of the strongest presidents, standing 183-192cm tall, weighing in at 95-100kg, he was
        known for his great strength. Recognizing the value of nutrition in achieving peak physical
        performance, he proclaimed November 26 as a day of Thanksgiving, encouraging fellow Americans to bulk
        up towards the winter. He spent the day fasting and visiting debtors in prison with meat and beer,
        further asserting his dominance.
